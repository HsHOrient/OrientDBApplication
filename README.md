# OrientDBApplication

This is an application to import a tcpdump file into an orientdb server instance.
In order to run this project, import it into ecplise and configure it to use maven to install the dependencies from `pom.xml`
Also make sure to make `src/resources` a source folder so that the configuration file `config.properties` is within the class path. (Use `config.properties.sample` to create your own `config.properties` file)
